Fifth Manual GDP valuation: Market prices Start/end months of reporting year: January/December Base year: 2015. DANE (Colombia Institute of Statistics) has done a rebasing of the national accounts (now base year is 2015 and before 2005). Data with the new base is ONLY AVAILABLE FROM 2005. The change also includes methodological changes (for example, direct estimation of private consumption based on a survey) and most important, change in the index formulae (historically a Laspeyres fixed-base index and now a Laspeyres chain index). The main implications are that the 2005 and 2015 series are not comparable and the chain index is associated with non-additivity of the components.
